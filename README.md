# RadioControl

!!Root Required!!

I created this app because of the lack of apps on the play store that enable airplane mode, while keeping wifi on. Probably because not many carriers have WiFi calling and SMS over WiFi

An app that auto toggles wifi and cell radio for maximum battery life

This app will probably only be useful to Project Fi users as it can disable radios while keeping wifi on if.
This could work for Republic Wireless users, but your device must be rooted, and most of their devices are hard to root without losing functionality.
